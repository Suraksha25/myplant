  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">Soil Preparation</h4>

  <p>Jasmine can be grown in a wide range of soils l.e., from clay soils to sandy loam soils with good drainage. For better production make sure the soil is rich by adding organic compost or any Farm Yard Manure (FMY).
  To control or remove the weeds, one or two initial ploughings are required in the main field, which is followed by digging of pits at a size of 30 cm by 30 cm by 30 cm. Add 10 to Live 12 kg of FYM to each pit before filling the pits: Best season for jasmine plantation is
   June. 1000 E November at a spacing of 1.5 mx 1.5 m is ideal.Most jasmine cultivars do best in rich, well-draining soil. Whether you're planting your jasmine in the ground or in a pot, prepare the soil by working in in 2-inch layer of compost. This will ensure that the jasmine produces healthy flowers throughout the growing season.
   If you're planting outside, check the spot you've chosen to make sure it drains well. Dig a hole and fill it with water. If the water quickly soaks into the hole and leaves it empty, the soil there drains well. If the water sits and drains slowly, choose a different planting spot.</p>
  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">Sowing</h4>
  <img src='https://gardenerspath.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Planting-Out-a-Jasmine-Vine.jpg' width={"280px"} height={"200px"} className="jas"></img>
  <p>Cover the seed with a light layer of soil. If you're planting a seedling, make sure the crown of the plant is level with the soil. Cover the roots completely.
If you're planting a seedling, loosen the roots with your hands to help it adapt to its new environment faster.
You can buy jasmine seeds or seedlings from most garden centers or nurseries.Slide the jasmine plant gently from its container and water the root ball. Tickle the roots by gently scratching them all over. Dig a hole twice the size of the root ball and set the jasmine plant inside. Leave the soil around the hole a little taller than the soil level of your plant, creating a reservoir for water. Lightly pat soil around the base of the jasmine plant to hold it in place. Water the soil around the base well 
to help the plant settle. Add more soil if necessary to keep the jasmine erect.</p>
<p>Another way to plant jasmine is to use semi-ripe cuttings taken from a mature jasmine plant. In mid-summer or fall, cut healthy 6-inch stems from a jasmine plant. Prepare a pot with a soil and compost mixture and push the stems into a pot. Overwinter the pot in a sunny window, keeping it well watered, and transplant it in the spring.

  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">Flowering</h4>

  <h5>Light Requirement</h5>
  <p>Jasmine needs full sun or part shade – usually about 6 hours or more of direct sunlight each day for full sun, and 2 – 4 hours per day for partial shade. The exact type of jasmine you plant, in addition to climate and other conditions, will determine how much sun a plant needs.</p>
  <h5>Water Requirement</h5>
  <p>Jasmine flowers that are in-ground should be watered once a week. If it is unusually dry or hot, increase the frequency, but let the soil dry out in between. If your jasmine is in a container, it will likely require water multiple times each week, especially in the hotter months. Water it once the top 1 inch of the soil is dry.</p>
  <h5>Temperature Requirement</h5>
  <p>The jasmine plant is a source of exotic fragrance in warmer climates. It is an important scent noted in perfumes, and also has herbal properties. The plants may be vines or bushes and some are evergreen. Most jasmine plants are found in tropical to sub-tropical climates, although a few may thrive in temperate zones. Protection from cold temperatures is one of the most important aspects of jasmine plant care.</p>
  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4">Harvesting</h4>
  <img src="https://www.agrifarming.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Growing-Jasmine-Flowers..jpg" width={"280px"} height={"200px"} className="jas"></img>
  <p>The plants start flowering six months after planting. However the commercial yields are taken from
the third year onwards. For fresh flowers, fully developed, unopened flower buds are hand-picked
early in the morning. The flowers should be handled carefully during harvest and transport.

Yield.A jasmine vine or shrub will produce many flowers throughout the season, and you may want to bring some indoors to display as part of an arrangement. Use a sharp pair of pruners to cut branches loaded with flowers and leaves. Place the stems in water right away to preserve their freshness.

Use a sharp pair of pruners to cut branches loaded with flowers and leaves. Place the stems in water right away to preserve their freshness.</li>
    <li>Jasmine plants can be propagated during the summer from tip cuttings.</li>
    <li>Not all jasmine varieties produce fragrance. If the scent is important to you, be sure to select a fragrant variety.</li>
    <li>Plant jasmine close to your home, patio, or walkway in order to enjoy its intense fragrance and to get a good view of the hummingbirds and butterflies that your jasmine will attract.</li>
    <li>Use a high phosphorus fertilizer (15-30-15) to encourage maximum blooming.</li>
    <li>Jasmine can grow vigorously under the right growing conditions. To control growth, the jasmine plants need frequent pinching. Cut back the jasmine plant after it has finished blooming and during the summer to control growth and prevent long vines from tangling if they are not being trained to climb a trellis or other support structure.</li>

  <h4>Diseases</h4>
  <h5>Leaf-blight </h5>
  <img src="https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VGH3CAPKLZBVJAKV6NVDANBDWI.jpg" width={"280px"} height={"200px"} className="jas"></img>
  <p>This disease occurs in a severe form on J. grandiflorum. Reddish-brown, circular spots are produced
on the upper surface of the leaves, spreading rapidly in the rainy season. The infected leaves curl and
start drying from the margins. Even the young shoots dry up. In severe cases of infection, vegetative
buds and young branches dry up. The flower production is very much reduced in infected plants.</p>
<p><b>Control:</b> Spraying of 0.4% Benlate solution, 0.2% Dithane M-45 or 0.1% Bordeaux mixture has been
found effective in control of the disease. 
</p>
<h5>Rust</h5>
<img src='https://www.allaboutjasmine.com/static/article_pics/70f3eb43f68651a2620.jpg' width={"280px"} height={"200px"} className="jas"></img>
<p>Rust occurs on all the aerial parts of the plants including flowers. Yellowish orange coloured
pustules appear on the lower side of the leaves and also on young twigs and flowers buds. The
infected parts become distorted.</p>
<p><b>Control:</b>The disease can be controlled by pruning the branches or spraying Copper Oxychloride
(0.3%) or Mancozeb (0.2%). Sulphur at the rate of 20-25 kg/ha is also useful.</p>
<h5>Wilt</h5>
<img src="https://thegreenthumbler.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jasmine-Powdery-Mildew.jpg" width={"280px"} height={"200px"} className="jas" ></img>
<p>The disease occurs in patches and the roots turn black. In the case of sclerotial wilt, in addition to
the above symptoms, white mycelia are found generally girdling the roots and the sclerotia are
found adhering to the roots of the wilted plants. </p>
<p><b>Control:</b>: Drenching the soil around the plant with 1% Bordeaux mixture controls this disease.</p>
