  <p>Different varieties of lemon trees are given below

Some of the varieties of lemon trees are Avalon Lemons. Bearss Lemons. Buddha's Hand Lemons Bush Lemons, Citron Lemons Dorshapo Lemons Eureka Lemons Fino Citron Lemons, Greek Citron Lemons Lisbon Lemons, Meyer Lemons, Organic Lemons Donderosa Lemons. Sweet Lemons, True Lemons, Verna Lemons. Genoan lemon Masero lemon, and Eureka lemon.Lemons 
are adapted to most well-drained soils and prefer soils with a pH level of 5.5 to 6.5 Rootstock choice for the soil type and conditions is critical Like most houseplants, lemon tree prefers a slightly acid, all-purpose mix, which you can get by using a peat moss based growing mixImportant step is to prepare the soil mixture. This is perhaps 
the most crucial stage as the plant will get all its nutrition from this soil. The soil should have 40 per cent of organic manure or fertiliser. Vermicompost, cow dung and other organic feed usually work best. The remaining part of the mixture should be gardening soil, which is normally mixed with sand.the best way to water the plant is in a gap of 2-3 days. The water quantity should be limited, but adequate. Do not pluck or damage the fresh green leaves as it will affect the healthy growth of the plant
The gardening expert said adding some cow dung manure after a month and a half of potting the plant will help to give added nutrition.
Lemon does best in well-draining soil. The pH level of soil should be around 5.5 to 7 as this plant prefers slightly acidic soil to neutral soil. You can also use equal parts of garden soil, cocopeat, and compost.</p>

  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">Sowing</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Moisten the potting soil therefore that it is damp but not soaked, all the way through</li>
    <li>Fill the smaller pot or container with soil all the way up to an inch below the rim</li>
    <li>Cut the open lemon and remove a seed Remove all of the pulp from the lemon surface A good method to do this is to simply suck on it until it is clean</li>
    <li>Do not delay to lemon plant The seed should still be moist when it is buried into the soit in the smaller pot Plant the seed about half an inch deep in the center of the pot</li>
    <li>Spray the soil that is directly above the seed gently with water by using spray bottle</li>
    <li>Cover the pot with clear plastic wrap seal the edges with a rubber band and poke small holes in the top with a pencil</li>
    <li>Place the pot or container in a warm, sunny location</li>
    <li>Spray on more amount of water occasionally, not allowing the soil to dry out Do not cause water to puddle though Just maintain the soil somewhat moist</li>
    <li>After about 2 weeks when the sprouting emerges take the plastic covering off if you want additional light for your lemon plant you can use a grow light to supplement the sun's light</li>
    <li>Take care of the young plant by keeping the soil damp, by making sure it gets at least 8 full hours of light per day, and by giving it moderate doses of organic fertilizer like compost</li>
    <li>Watch over the plant to ensure it is not attacked by bugs or diseases Prune off brown,dead leaves when needed. Use more pesticides if you must.</li>
    <li>When the lemon plant outgrows its small pot, put it in the larger pot. You will go through much the same process when you re-plant it as when you first planted. Younger plants require more water than older plants, but they all do need adequate water.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Temperature Requirement:</h5>
  <p>The temperature required for the lemon tree will be warmer climate with acceptable temperature range being between 70 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 38°C) with the best temperature around 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29-30°C). Above 105 degrees (40°C) lemon tree will stop to grow, while below 50 degrees (10°C) this tree will go into the dormancy.</p>
  <h5>Light Requirement:</h5>
  <p>Set lemon tree in full sun from a southern exposure Lemon trees need lots of light If that's not possible, supplement the light by installing 40-watt fluorescent shop lights above the lemon tree particularly important in the winter season, when they need 12 hours of light.</p>
  <h5>Watering:</h5>
  <p>Getting the watering requirements right with your lemon tree is crucial for a successful harvest. During the period of establishment, more frequent watering will be required—even as much as once or twice a week. Once mature, lemon trees develop more drought tolerance.
During the summer months, the soil should be kept moist, especially for young trees. Be careful not to cause waterlogging as boggy conditions are problematic.</p>
  <h5>Fruiting Stage</h5>
  <p>There are several cultural situations that prevent fruit. When planting the tree, place it on the southern or western side of the home. Lemon tree fruiting will only occur in warm temperatures. Choose a well drained area with shelter from damaging and drying winds. Use thermal covers or even just an old blanket to protect new buds or little fruits when unexpected freezes occur. Also, make sure the fertilizer you apply in early spring is formulated for citrus trees and is high in potash. Avoid excess nitrogen during the flowering period as this spurs leafy growth but minimizes the production of flowers.</p>
  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4">Harvesting</h4>

  <p>It's natural for the flowers to develop into fruit and still take a year to mature to yellow and be mature for harvest. Leave the lemons on the tree to ripen. Like other citrus fruits, they will not ripen off the tree.
Each fruit packs citric acid and plenty of vitamin C. Welcome lemons into your garden and you'll have nutritious, cheerful fruits to last a lifetime. They are perfect for adding to meal recipes and even as an environmentally friendly cleaning option.All plants of the citrus family are heavy feeders, and lemon tree to requires fertilizer to generate juicy fruits, lush foliage, and fragrant blooms. Use particular purpose citrus fertilizers for every citrus species plant, if unavailable use slow-release fertilizer of NPK 12-6-6.
Look for a fertilizer that contains micronutrients, particularly iron, manganese, and zinc To give boost feed to lemon tree apply a water-soluble fertilizer once in a month in the growing season Occasionally, sides dress your lemon plant with compost or well-rotted manure</p>
  <h5>How and When to harvest Lemons?</h5>
  <p>Lemon trees normally take around two to three years to bear fruit and harvesting depends on the variety of plant.
Lemons are ready to harvest when fruits have developed full color and flavor.Harvest lemons when their peels are yellow color or only a green tinge, with a slightly glossy appearance. The longer the fruit stays on the tree the sweeter it will become so some suggest picking and tasting the fruit to determine how the crop is developing.
To pick lemons, use the twist, tilt method and snap method. Take the entire fruit in your hand and twist it gently, tilting and pulling away until it breaks free.</p>
  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading5">Tips</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Choose a pot that is 25% bigger than the root ball of the lemon plant.</li>
    <li>A clay pot is ideal because unlike plastic it is porous and evaporates water from sides, this helps the lemon tree to produce well as it dislikes being waterlogged.</li>
    <li>The quality and type of potting soil is a necessary factor as well.</li>
    <li>For growing high yielding lemon plants, use a well-draining organic potting mix.</li>
    <li>Most lemon trees require eight to 12 hours of sunlight daily When growing lemon trees indoors, position your plants beside a south-facing window with good airflow.</li>
    <li>Most lemon trees can take about 3 years after planting to yield some lemons suitable for picking that is long as they are cared for correctly. If you grow a lemon tree from seed, it could take from three-six years for the tree to be capable of producing fruit.</li>
    <li>Plant some lemon seeds about ½ inches deep to increase the chance for lemon seed propagation Moisten the soil lightly and cover the top of the pot or container with plastic wrap to aid in water retention. Maintain the soil moist, but not soggy.</li>
    <li>Generally, lemon trees do not tolerate cold snaps well. Temperatures dropping below 29 degrees Fahrenheit contribute to wood and fruit damage, along with dropped lemon leaves.</li>

  </ul>
  <h4>Diseases</h4>
  <img src="https://foodgardening.mequoda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Citrus-Canker-740x493.jpg" width={"280px"} height={"200px"} className="sow"></img>
  <h5>Cirus Cracker</h5>
  <p>A highly contagious bacterial infection, citrus canker causes yellow halo-like lesions on fruit, leaves and twigs of citrus trees. If allowed to progress unchecked, this lemon tree problem will eventually result in dieback, fruit drop, and leaf loss. This disease is spread through the air with the aid of air currents, birds, insects and even humans.</p>
  <p><b>Control:</b>Spray with liquid copper fungicide as a preventative for treating citrus canker lemon disease. If the tree is already infected, there is no treatment and the tree will have to be destroyed.</p>
  <h5>Sooty mold fungus</h5>
  <img src="https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/6f66ee666c3cabc6b2b6331ffd4f12f3?width=1024" width={"280px"} height={"200px"} className="sow"></img>
  <p> Sooty mold is a fungal infection resulting in black leaves. This mold is the result of honeydew excreted from aphids, whiteflies and mealybugs. To eradicate sooty mold, you must first control the insect infestation</p>
  <p><b>Control</b>Spray the lemon tree with Neem oil insecticide, both the top and undersides of the foliage. You may need to repeat in 10-14 days, depending upon the extent of the infestation. Follow up by treating the mold growth with liquid copper fungicide.</p>
  <h5>Phytophthora fungus</h5>
  <img src="https://www.yates.co.nz/media/plants/problem-solver/diseases/lemon-scab_1551155013616.jpeg" width={"280px"} height={"200px"} className="sow"></img>
  <p>Phytophthora root rot or brown rot or collar rot is caused by the phytophthora fungus resulting in hard dark brown patches on the trunk of the tree often accompanied by oozing from the affected area. As the disease progresses, the patches dry, crack and die leaving a dark, sunken area. Fruit may also be affected with brown and decayed spots. This fungus lives in the soil, especially wet soil, where it is splashed up onto the tree during heavy rain or irrigation.</p>
  <p><b>Control:</b>To treat, remove all infected leaves and dropped fruit from the ground. Prune the lower branches from the tree, those that are more than 2 feet (.6 m.) from the ground. Then spray with a fungicide such as Agri-Fos or Captan.</p>
